        <!-- A short paragraph with a little bit about what I've been spending my time on during the pandemic. -->

        <p>During the pandemic, my husband and I threw caution to the wind and moved first to New York City and then to Orlando. His job went remote, so we were free to wander. I also started at Valencia, so I could learn about film and digital media, kind of as a bucket list, second-education pursuit.</p>
